# MS2

![Responsive](https://github.com/M-E-C-20/)

This is my website which will be used to advertise a small local garage.
It should feature the services offered and a price guide, an about page, a gallery and a contact page.
the primary goal is to intice customers to make contact with the garage via the contact page.

To do this I will need to make a comprehensive guide of services are available and use the price guide to give the customer confidence in what they are spending they're money on.
To bolster this confidence, I will include an about page and a gallery.
On the gallery page I will include some images of the garage and some helpful tips for self maintenance for the customer.
