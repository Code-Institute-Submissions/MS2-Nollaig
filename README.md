# MS2

![Responsive](https://github.com/M-E-C-20/)

This is my website which will be used to advertise a small local garage.
It should feature the services offered and a price guide, an about page, a gallery and a contact page.
the primary goal is to intice customers to make contact with the garage via the contact page.

To do this I will need to make a comprehensive guide of services are available and use the price guide to give the customer confidence in what they are spending they're money on.
To bolster this confidence, I will include an about page and a gallery.
On the gallery page I will include some images of the garage and some helpful tips for self maintenance for the customer.

## UX

### User Stories

- As a new user, I would like to find out about Christmas events which I can attend happening in Ireland.
- As a new user, I would like to find out where these events are happening.
- As a new user, I would like to be able to redirect to these event's official webpage for more information if I choose to.
- As a new user, I would like to use this website as a way to get me and my family in a festive mood in the lead up to Christmas.
- As a new user, I would like to be able to send a letter to Santa for my children, and get a personalised response in return.
- As the owner, I want my site to be easily navigable for users.
- As the owner, I wish to provide a festive setting for people to build excitement in the run up to Christmas.
- As the owner, I want to inform visitors of Christmas events happening in Ireland.
- As the owner, I want my website to be friendly to users of all ages.

### Strategy

The main goal of this website is to be an avenue for users of all ages to enable themselves to enjoy the festivities at Christmas time.
This will be done by allowing users to discover where Christmas events happening around Ireland. The users will also be able to 
discover more about these events from using external links navigating them to more specific content about these events. 
Users with children will be able to send a message to Santa, and receive an email directed to their children. This website should be easy to navigate and
be clear in it's purpose to any user.

### Scope

I want to use a clear and warm design to fit in with the Christmas theme of this website.
It is important to use a clear, intuitive interface to avoid delivering a poor user experience.

### Structure

In each section I want to keep a common navbar and a common footer. In the header there will be a navbar with site links and a logo.
In the footer section there will be copyright mark and social media icons which will act as buttons linking to their respective sites.

### Skeleton

### Surface

#### Colours


### Fonts

For headings, I have used the "Mountains of Christmas" font. I think it suits a Christmas themed website and is a very festive themed font.
For any other blocks of text, I have used the "Lora" font, which I also think arries a festive spirit, but is more practical for blocks of more descriptive text.

### Icons

I used the hamburger icon for my menu because it is widely recognised and used.
In the footer I used standard icons for copyright, Facebook, Youtube and Instagram. All icons used in this project were sourced from Font Awesome.
